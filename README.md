# Commit

Live demo [here](https://pre-commit-frontend.vercel.app/home).

Hackathon project for [ETH Bogota 2022](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/commit-mx3ch). This is the smart contract repo. Here are other relevant repos for our project:
 - [Frontend](https://github.com/ibremseth/modular-micro-loans-frontend)
 - [Backend](https://github.com/gustavoguimaraes/backend-modular-microloan)
 - [Subgraph](https://github.com/gustavoguimaraes/modular-microloans-subgraph)

## Polygon

We want our project to have a tangible impact and view it as community infrastructure/a public good. We believe that commits could be a new funding model in communities such as LATAM and the Global South, where high-trust investments could reduce uncertainty in funding underserved projects. As more of these projects get funded, underserved communities will begin to flourish, creating a positive feedback loop for more local projects to get funded and create more inclusion and regenerative opportunities.

We are targeting the $4k prize pool for deploying at least one smart contract on Polygonâ€™s testnet  as well as the $4k prize for best local LATAM public goods.
